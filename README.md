# The GENOMPARC stack
> **The GENOMPARC stack** is modern open-source software developer stack for linux operating systems - actually ArchLinux, including latest releases of latest awesome modern technologies.
Initially it was GNOMEARC, but this abbr not includes PHP (that i want in stack) and it may have problems with original GNOME desktop rights, so I reorder the it.

#### The Abbreviation
**G**it, (**E**)nginx, **N**ode.js, M**o**ngoDB, **M**ATE desktop, **P**HP, **A**mbiance Ubuntu theme, **R**uby, Ar**c**h Linux

#### The software
- Git v2.3.0
- Nginx v1.7.10
- Node.js v0.12 (or IO.js v1.1.0)
- MongoDB v2.6.7
- MATE Desktop v1.8.0
- PHP v5.6.5
- Ruby v2.2.0
- ArchLinux 2015.02.01

#### The idea
- Build it
- Share it
- Open-source it as ISO (separate distro?)
- It should be clean and without unnecessary packages
- It should be with oldschool GNOME2 look and feel 
- It should be developer-oriented

**mpm** - Right-handed, easy, apt-like and friendly package manager, build on top of pacman. Maybe some bash script?
- mpm install \<name\>
- mpm update
- mpm update \<name\>
- etc
